# Node Farm

This is a small project to deeply understand
  - `http`
  - `fs`
  - `url`
built in core modules of Node.js. I coded along with [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://twitter.com/jonasschmedtman?lang=en) in this course.

## Installation

Clone the source code:

    git clone git@github.com:toptaskalender/node-farm.git

Install dependencies:

    npm install

## Starting the app

Run `npm start` / `npm run watch` to start the application.
